# Client Data Management:
- Add Client: Input client details (ID, name, industry, contact person, revenue) and
incorporate them into the system.
- Update Client: Change existing client details.
- Remove Client: Mark the client as inactive in the system.
- View Clients: Show a list of all current clients with their details.
